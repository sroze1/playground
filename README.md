# playground
This is labelled 'Playground' as it is deemed a testing area for various problems and challenges.

Currently, the preference for resolving and testing problems for solutions is to view it on the console.log as 
it provides insight into the code step by step, and is more convenient as opposed to testing in the browser by typing manually 
than it is using an editor

The file in which JavaScript code will be written is Playground.js
The second file labelled TestConsole.html is a basic HTML file linked to Playground.js
